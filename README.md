I made this project because I found it difficult having to switch between applications on Windows to adjust individual sound levels. So I found a open source project called Deej on Github and used that as inspiration to build my own custom one, featuring sliders and RGB indicators for their respective volumes. It also just looks cool on a setup along with my existing audio gear.
